# Kilometro-Zero

## Introduction

This project was developed at Ironhack for Module 2. The purpose was to develop a webpage using MongoDB as a database.

Kilometro-Zero is the pre-conception of a future sustainable online store in mind.

The website is divided in two parts:

- the User side and the Admin side;
- the User can interact immediatly with our Product Details, Tips & Tricks and Store page, but if they want to have a favorite list they need to sign up and log in;
- the Admin has interaction with all the products, being the only ones able to Create, Update and Delete them.
